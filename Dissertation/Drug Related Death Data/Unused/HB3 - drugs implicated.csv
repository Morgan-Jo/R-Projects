"1) More than one drug may be reported per death. These are mentions of each drug, and should not be added to give total deaths. Up to 2007, some pathologists reported only those drugs which they thought caused, or contributed to, the death. With effect from 2008, pathologists report separately (a) drugs which were implicated in, or which potentially contributed to, the cause of death and (b) other drugs which were present but which were not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death. The figures in this table are on the first basis - i.e. basis (a) - which has been the normal basis for figures for individual drugs with effect from 'Drug-related Deaths in Scotland in 2009'. There may be other differences between years and/or areas in the way in which the information was produced - more information can be found in Annex C.

"2) The table shows a combined figure for 'heroin/morphine' because it is believed that, in the overwhelming majority of cases where morphine has been identified in post-mortem toxicological tests, its presence is the result of heroin use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) The distinction between ""prescribable"" and ""street"" benzodiazepines is as specified by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (now part of Public Health Scotland) - see Annex H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) Percentages are given only for those areas which had at least the specified total number of drug-related deaths, because the figures for areas with relatively few drug-related deaths may be subject to large percentage year-to-year ""random"" fluctuations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

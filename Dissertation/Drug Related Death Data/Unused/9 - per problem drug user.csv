Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) Estimates of problem drug users aged 15 to 64, as published by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (now part of Public Health Scotland).  When this edition of the publication was produced, the latest estimates available were those for 2015/16 that were published by ISD on 5 March 2019. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The 95% Confidence Intervals are the range within which it is expected that the true value will lie. On the basis of statistical theory, there is only a 5% chance that a 95% Confidence Interval will not include the (unknown) true value of the quantity which is being estimated - so, on average, one would expect that 19 out of 20 of all 95% Confidence Intervals will include the (unknown) true values. ISD did not publish confidence intervals for the numbers for each sex or for each age-group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) The average of the percentage differences between (a) the estimate and the lower end of the 95% Confidence Interval and (b) the estimate and the upper end of the 95% Confidence Interval. It is calculated using the rounded values of the estimate and the two ends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) These death rates are broad indications only, as (e.g.) the estimated numbers of problem drug users may be subject to wide confidence intervals.  The rates for 'All', 'Males' and 'Females' may be slightly over-estimated, because their numerators are the numbers of deaths of all ages (including the small proportions aged 0-14 and 65+) whereas their denominators are the estimated numbers of problem drug users aged 15-64.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) The 'from' value in the range for the rate is calculated using the upper end of the 95% Confidence Interval for the estimated number of problem drug users, and the 'to' value in the range for the rate is calculated using the lower end of the 95% Confidence Interval for the estimated number of problem drug users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

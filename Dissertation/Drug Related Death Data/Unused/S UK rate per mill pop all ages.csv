,"** E+W ""drug misuse"" deaths and UK population figures will come (after publication in August 2021) from ONS website - see Annex G for 'drug-death' links",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The E+W ""drug misuse"" deaths figure were not due to be published until August 2021, so NRS could not produce,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"for NRS's publication in July 2021, an estimate of the UK drug-related/misuse death rate for 2020 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"*** the figure for Northern Ireland for 2020 may not have been published at the time that figures for Wngland and Wales become available, so",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,NRS could assume that it will be exactly the same as it was for 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,in order to estimate a number and rate for the UK as a whole for 2020. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It is expected that such estimates will have, at worst, only very small percentage margins of error, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,because Northern Ireland accounted for under 4% of drug-deaths in the UK in 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

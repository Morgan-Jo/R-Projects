Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) Estimates of problem drug users aged 15 to 64, as published by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (now part of Public Health Scotland).  These estimates for 2015/16 were the latest estimates available when this publication was produced. Some of the estimates are subject to potentially large percentage margins of error, as indicated by the 95% Confidence Intervals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The 95% Confidence Intervals are the range within which it is expected that the true value will lie. On the basis of statistical theory, there is only a 5% chance that a 95% Confidence Interval will not include the (unknown) true value of the quantity which is being estimated - so, on average, one would expect that 19 out of 20 of all 95% Confidence Intervals will include the (unknown) true values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) The average of the percentage differences between (a) the estimate and the lower end of the 95% Confidence Interval and (b) the estimate and the upper end of the 95% Confidence Interval. It is calculated using the rounded values of the estimate and the two ends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) These death rates are broad indications only, as (e.g.) the estimated numbers of problem drug users may be subject to wide confidence intervals.  The rates may also tend to be slightly over-estimated, because their numerators are the numbers of deaths of all ages (including the small proportions aged 0-14 and 65+) whereas their denominators are the estimated numbers of problem drug users aged 15-64.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These figures were calculated using the annual average number of drug-deaths for 2013-2017 and the estimated numbers of problem drug users for 2015/16. The 'error bars' in chart 5 indicate the likely ranges of values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) The 'from' value in the range for the rate is calculated using the upper end of the 95% Confidence Interval for the estimated number of problem drug users, and the 'to' value in the range for the rate is calculated using the lower end of the 95% Confidence Interval for the estimated number of problem drug users, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The numbers of drug-related deaths for each area are based on the Board boundaries that apply with effect from 1 April 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The figures that have been used for earlier years are the numbers that would have been seen had the new boundaries applied in those years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The estimated numbers of problem drug users are also based on the Board boundaries that applied with effect from April 2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

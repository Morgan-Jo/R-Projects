1) Paragraph A3 in Annex A explains why these kinds of deaths are excluded from the standard definition of 'drug-related death' figures produced by National Records of Scotland (NRS.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Including, for example, deaths caused by infections that resulted from the use of heroin which was contaminated by, say, anthrax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Including, for example, accidental deaths which were caused by the use of drugs which were not controlled at the time, such as those before 16 April 2010 which resulted from using mephedrone (assuming that no controlled drugs were found in the body).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Only a proportion of deaths from these causes can be attributed to drug misuse - more information can be found in paragraph B8 of Annex B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) 'ICD10' is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6) More information can be found in paragraph B13 of Annex B about the statistics that the ICDP produced. A few deaths per year may be counted both in the 'ICDP' figures and in the standard drug-related death statistics produced by NRS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7) More information can be found in paragraph B14 of Annex B.  Again, some deaths are counted both in these figures and in the standard drug-related death statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

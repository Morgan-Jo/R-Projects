"1) Part (i) of this table gives the number of deaths for which each of the specified drugs was the only drug which was found to be present in the body. For example, a death for which:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(a) both cocaine and alcohol were implicated would be counted twice: once under 'cocaine' and once under 'alcohol';,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) both cocaine and alcohol were implicated, and methadone was found to be present in the body but was not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death, would not be counted at all in the upper part of the table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The final column of part (i) gives the number of drug-related deaths for which alcohol was found to be present in the body together with only one drug.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Part (ii) of this table gives the number of deaths for which each of the specified drugs was the only drug which was considered to have been implicated in, or potentially contributed, to the cause of death. The pathologist may have reported that other drugs were present in the body - but, if so, the pathologist did not consider that they had any direct contribution to the death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The final column of part (ii) gives the number of drug-related deaths for which alcohol was thought, by the pathologist, to be implicated in the cause of death together with only one drug. For example, a death for which:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(a) both cocaine and alcohol were implicated would be counted twice: once under 'cocaine' and once under 'alcohol'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) both cocaine and alcohol were implicated, and methadone was found to be present in the body but was not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death, would also be counted under 'cocaine' and 'alcohol' (but it would not be counted under 'methadone').",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) cocaine, methadone and alcohol were all implicated would not be counted at all in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost all the deaths which are counted in part (i) of the table are also counted in part (ii) of the table.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, there may be a few exceptions: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a drug-related death for which National Records of Scotland (NRS) was told that only one drug (and, perhaps, alcohol) was found to be present, and for which NRS was not told that it was considered to have been implicated in (or potentially contributed to) the cause of the death, will be counted in part (i) of the table but not in part (ii).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, an occasional figure in part (i) of the table may be larger than the corresponding figure in part (ii) of the table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The table shows a combined figure for 'heroin/morphine' because it is believed that, in the overwhelming majority of cases where morphine has been identified in post-mortem toxicological tests, its presence is the result of heroin use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) This is any kind of drug other than an opiate or opioid, a benzodiazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, cocaine, an ecstasy-type drug or an amphetamine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

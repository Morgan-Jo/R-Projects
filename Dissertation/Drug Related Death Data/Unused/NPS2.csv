Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) The substances which are counted (for the purpose of these figures) as 'New Psychoactive Substances' are described in Annex E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) For example, the death was after 15 April 2010, the cause of death was certified as 'mephedrone intoxication', and no other substance was said to have been found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) For example, the cause of death was certified as 'adverse effects of methadone and mephedrone'.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that the date of death is not a factor, because methadone has 'always' been controlled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) For example, the death occurred up to 15 April 2010, the cause of death was certified as 'mephedrone intoxication', and no other substance was said to have been found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) For example, the death occurred up to 15 April 2010, and both mephedrone and an uncontrolled volatile substance were said to be implicated in, or potentially contributed, to the death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) For example, the cause of death was given as 'heroin, alcohol and diazepam toxicity', and BZP and TFMPP were also present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7) An artificial example would be a death which occurred up to 15 April 2010, co-codamol was said to be implicated in, or potentially contributed, to the death; mephedrone was said to be present but did not contribute to the death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) As defined by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The 'European Drug Report' figures were taken from Table A6 on page 52 of the EMCDDA's ‘European Drug Report 2021’ (NB: the ""EU"" totals EXCLUDE any countries for which figures were unavailable).  The report was published on 9 June 2021 and is available via this link:",,,,,,,,,,,

"Most countries' figures are for 2019, but some are for 2018 or earlier years.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Page 41 of the EMCDDA's ""2021"" report (which has several charts showing the numbers of drug-induced deaths) includes the following statement:",,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to methodological differences and potential under-reporting in some countries, comparisons between countries may not be valid",,,,,,,,,,,
and the following wording appears at the foot of Table A6:,,,,,,,,,,,
Overdose data must be interpreted with caution.  Methodological differences should be considered when comparing between countries.,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) The EMCDDA's table indicates that the UK's figures are for 2017, and (in this edition) a footnote says that  ""drug-induced deaths data do not include Northern Ireland"".    Public Health England has confirmed that that is the case: the ""UK"" figures are for 2017 and (on this occasion) cover only Great Britain rather than the UK as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) These figures for Scotland are for the same year as the ""UK"" figures in the EMCDDA's table",,,,,,,,,,,
5) These figures for Scotland are for the same year as the figures for a few of the other countries that are shown in the EMCDDA's table,,,,,,,,,,,
6) These figures for Scotland are for the same year as the figures for most of the other countries that are shown in the EMCDDA's table,,,,,,,,,,,
"7) These figures for Scotland are for the most recent year, and so are more up-to-date than the figures for all the other countries that are shown in the EMCDDA's table",,,,,,,,,,,
"8) These figures for drug-induced deaths for 2018 (for GB, not for the UK as a whole) were provided to NRS by Public Health England, which confirmed that that they are for 2018 and cover only Great Britain (rather than the UK as a whole).",,,,,,,,,,,

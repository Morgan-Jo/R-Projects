1) Using the population in the middle of the 5-year period as a proxy for the average population over the whole period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The statistics for each area are based on the boundaries that apply with effect from 1 April 2014. Earlier years' figures show what the numbers would have been had the new boundaries applied in those years. For 2001, 2003 and 2006, there are differences of one or two between the overall total for the year and the sum of the figures for the individual areas. This is due to the use of a new database - further information can be found at the end of Annex A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

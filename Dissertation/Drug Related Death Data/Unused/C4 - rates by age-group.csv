Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Calculated by dividing the average number of drug-related deaths per year over the specified 5-year period by the estimated population in the middle of the 5-year period (which is a proxy for the average population over the whole of the period).,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Some other tables which provide figures by age-group give the number of drug-related deaths of people who were aged under 25. However, this column's figures are for ages 15-24, inclusive, as there are very few drug-related deaths of people aged 0-14.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) Some other tables which provide figures by age-group give the number of drug-related deaths of people who were aged 55 and over. However, this column's figures are for ages 55-64, inclusive, as there are relatively few drug-related deaths of people aged 65 and over.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Including ages 0-14 and 65+.,,,,,,,,,,,
"5) An occasional figure for Scotland may differ slightly from the corresponding 5-year average in Table 8, because the latter was calculated simply by taking the average of the figures for Scotland for each of the five individual years (rather than by applying the method described in footnote 1 to the figures for Scotland).",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) With effect from the ""... in 2016"" edition of this publication, the alphabetical order of the councils changed due to the adoption of the preferred forms of reference for the Edinburgh and Western Isles areas. Previous versions of this table used the forms 'Edinburgh, City of' and 'Eilean Siar'.
